Straight Trippin' is a social media website made just for travel enthusiasts. Designed to be a mix between Facebook and TripAdvisor users can post and read about travel recommendations and interact with other users for a more personalized experience.

The creation of the site was guided by fleshed out user stories. A feature git branch workflow and consistent deployment helped ensure a quality product throughout development. The front-end was built with AngularJS and styled with the help of Tachyons. On the back-end an express server was built using Node and Knex in order to connect to the Postgresql database. Straight Trippin' was deployed to Heroku and images were stored in Cloudinary.
